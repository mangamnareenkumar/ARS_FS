## How to Use the New Features

### Theme Customization

The theme can be further customized by editing the `src/theme.js` file. You can change colors, typography, and component styling.

### Animations

Framer Motion is used for animations. You can customize animations by modifying the motion components:

```jsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
>
  {/* Your content */}
</motion.div>
```

### CSS Effects

Additional CSS effects are available in `src/App.css`. You can apply these classes to your components:

- `animated-card`: Card with hover animation
- `pulse-button`: Button with pulsing effect
- `fade-in`: Element with fade-in animation
- `hover-effect`: Element with hover lift effect
- `wave-effect`: Button with ripple effect

## Browser Compatibility

The new frontend is compatible with:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Performance Considerations

- Animations are optimized for performance using GPU acceleration
- Lazy loading is implemented for PDF viewer
- Component rendering is optimized with React's memo and useCallback

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Dark mode toggle
- More interactive data visualizations
- Responsive design improvements for mobile devices
- Accessibility enhancements

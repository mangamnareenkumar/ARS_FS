# Frontend Fixes

This document outlines the fixes made to resolve the errors in the frontend code.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Material-UI Grid Component Issues

**Error:**
```
MUI Grid: The `item` prop has been removed and is no longer necessary.
MUI Grid: The `xs` prop has been removed.
MUI Grid: The `sm` prop has been removed.
```

**Fix:**
- Replaced Grid components with Stack components
- Updated the layout in studentRecords.jsx to use Stack instead of Grid
- Used the Stack component's direction and spacing props for responsive layout

### 2. Box Component Not Defined Error

**Error:**
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: Box is not defined at AnimatedTable.jsx:83:18
```

**Fix:**
- Added Box import to AnimatedTable.jsx
- Ensured all necessary Material-UI components are properly imported

### 3. Display Prop Deprecation

**Issue:**
Using the display prop directly on MUI components is deprecated in newer versions.

**Fix:**
- Replaced all instances of `display="flex"` with `sx={{ display: 'flex' }}`
- Updated all components to use the sx prop for styling
- Applied this fix to:
  - Header.jsx
  - StudentFilters.jsx
  - studentRecords.jsx
  - AnimatedTable.jsx
  - StyledReportDialog.jsx

### 4. React-PDF Compatibility Issues

**Issue:**
The react-pdf library was causing compatibility issues with the current React version.

**Fix:**
- Simplified the PDF viewer to use an iframe instead of react-pdf
- Created a simpler PdfViewer component that loads PDFs directly
- Removed unnecessary dependencies related to PDF.js

### 5. Package.json Dependencies

**Issue:**
The package.json file contained incompatible versions of dependencies.

**Fix:**
- Updated all dependencies to compatible versions:
  - React 18.2.0
  - Material-UI 5.14.20
  - Framer Motion 10.16.16
  - Other dependencies adjusted accordingly

### 6. Theme Configuration Issues

**Issue:**
The theme.js file contained a shadows array that was causing compatibility issues.

**Fix:**
- Removed the shadows array from the theme configuration
- Kept the component styling overrides that were working correctly

## How to Apply These Fixes

1. Replace the affected files with the fixed versions
2. Update the package.json file with the correct dependencies

4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
